Text Classification Research Project

I am pleased to present the completed research project for the Text Classification component of module 771767, focusing on the application of deep learning systems in text classification tasks. This project constitutes 80% of the total marks for the module, with the remaining 20% allocated to the presentation component.

Assignment Overview:

Research Question: The project aimed to implement a deep learning system for text classification, allowing flexibility in choosing the classes to be classified, such as sentiments, emotions, topics, or named entities.
Literature Review: The research question was situated within the broader context of existing academic literature on text classification, highlighting similarities, differences, and contributions to the field.
Methodology: Utilized a deep learning approach, with a choice of neural network architecture (e.g., recurrent or transformer) implemented using a deep learning library. Additional technical components, such as data augmentation techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, GPT), were incorporated.
Experimental Setup: Described the experimental setup, including hyperparameters, datasets, training-test split, baselines, and evaluation metrics.
Results and Discussion: Presented results supported with visualizations (graphs, tables, etc.) and discussed their implications, comparing with baselines and addressing whether objectives were met.
Conclusion: Summarized main findings, suggested future research directions, and provided insights into potential further investigations.
References: Included a substantial number of academic references beyond the provided literature resources for the module.
Key Tasks and Achievements:

Research Question: Clearly stated the research question or hypothesis, linking it to existing academic literature and demonstrating its significance within the field of text classification.
Methodology: Made an informed choice of neural network architecture and additional technical components, ensuring a robust experimental setup.
Experimental Setup: Paid attention to evaluation metrics and designed the experimental setup convincingly to demonstrate the intended outcomes.
Results and Discussion: Presented results effectively with visualizations, comparing them with baselines and providing insightful discussions.
Conclusion: Summarized the main points of the paper, suggested avenues for future research, and made a compelling case for further investigation.
Presentation Details:

Delivered a concise 1-minute pitch focusing on the project's main idea, significance, and expected outcomes.
Ensured clarity and effectiveness in presentation skills, maintaining relevance to slides and engaging the audience within the specified time limit.
Code Submission:

Submitted code alongside the report, ensuring it supports the functionality described and is not plagiarized.
Conclusion:
Overall, the completion of this research project demonstrates proficiency in applying deep learning techniques to text classification tasks, conducting comprehensive experiments, and effectively communicating findings. The adherence to deadlines, clarity in presentation, and thoroughness in research contribute to a comprehensive submission.TEXT CLASSIFICATION : SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - A REVIEW USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES
